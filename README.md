# Open Whiteboard

A collaborative whiteboard with hand-drawn style for sketching diagrams, wireframes, flowcharts, and visual brainstorming. Built with **Excalidraw + Preact + Tailwind CSS + Hono + SQLite**. Deploys to Cloudflare Workers via [Clawnify](https://clawnify.com).

## Features

- **Excalidraw canvas** — full drawing toolkit with shapes, text, arrows, freehand, and eraser
- **Hand-drawn aesthetic** — sketchy, informal style powered by Rough.js for a natural whiteboard feel
- **Drawing gallery** — grid view of all saved drawings with element count preview
- **Auto-save** — changes persisted automatically with 2-second debounce
- **Inline rename** — click the drawing title in the editor to rename on the spot
- **Export** — PNG and SVG export built into the Excalidraw toolbar
- **Dark mode** — toggle between light and dark canvas themes
- **Grid mode** — snap-to-grid for precise layouts
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — full Excalidraw shortcut set (Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+D duplicate, etc.)
- **URL-based routing** — deep-linkable `/drawing/:id` URLs with browser back/forward support
- **Shape library** — access Excalidraw's community shape libraries

# Whiteboard App Template

A collaborative whiteboard application built with Excalidraw, Preact, and Hono. Provides a hand-drawn style canvas for sketching diagrams, wireframes, flowcharts, and visual brainstorming.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Preact + Excalidraw + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend:** Hono REST API with Zod-validated routes
- **Database:** SQLite (better-sqlite3) — drawings stored as JSON scene data
- **Build:** Vite with Preact preset

## Key Features

- Excalidraw canvas with all drawing tools (shapes, text, arrows, freehand)
- Drawing gallery with create/rename/delete
- Auto-save with 2-second debounce
- URL-based routing (`/drawing/:id`)
- Hand-drawn sketch aesthetic
- Dark mode toggle
- Export to PNG/SVG (built into Excalidraw)

## Data Model

### drawings
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `name` TEXT — drawing title
- `scene_data` TEXT — JSON containing Excalidraw elements, appState, and files
- `created_at` TEXT
- `updated_at` TEXT

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /api/drawings | List all drawings |

## Customization Points

- **Libraries:** Custom shape libraries can be loaded via `initialData.libraryItems`
- **Custom fonts:** Excalidraw uses Virgil (hand-drawn) and Cascadia (code) fonts by default
- **Grid:** Grid mode can be enabled/disabled
